    <p id="about">

        Hi! My name is Dylan Huang and I am current student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Engineering.

        I grew up in the heart of the silicon valley - Palo Alto (Gunn High School Class of 2015 ~ Go Titans)! 

        Besides learning about computers and honing my web development skills, I like to jam out on guitar, play and watch basketball/soccer/badminton, and cruise around on my pennyboard!
